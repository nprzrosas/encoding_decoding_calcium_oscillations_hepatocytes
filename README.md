# Encoding and Decoding Calcium Oscillations in Hepatocytes

This repository contains the Python code for the manuscript  “Larsen AZ, Olsen LF, Kummer U. On the encoding and decoding of calcium signals in hepatocytes. Biophys Chem. 2004 Jan 1;107(1):83-99”. The code was built by [Dhulika Ravinuthala](http://www.linkedin.com/in/dhulika) and [Dr. Norma C Pérez Rosas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nprzrosas). This work was done within BME 695 and ABE 691: Quantitative Systems Biology Course at the Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering, Purdue University, Fall 2022. 

Anyone can run the code by using the Google Collaboratory Notebook. In the notebook, you will find different outputs that produce simple periodic spiking and bursting calcium oscillations, phase portraits, and bifurcation diagrams.
